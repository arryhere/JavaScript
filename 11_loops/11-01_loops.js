/*
• Loops
• Most of the activities we do in life are full of repetitions
• Imagine if I ask you to print out from 0 to 100 using console.log()
• To implement this simple task it may take you 2 to 5 minutes, such kind of tedious and repetitive task can be carried out using loop.
• In programming languages to carry out repetitive task we use different kinds of loops

/*
• for - loops through a block of code a number of times
• for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
• for/in - loops through the properties of an object
• while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
